# Prompt Capture UX Design Overview

## Design Principles

1. **Non-intrusive**: Capture should not interrupt the coding flow
2. **Flexible**: Support both active and passive capture modes
3. **Contextual**: Preserve the relationship between prompts and generated code
4. **Searchable**: Enable easy retrieval and organization of captured prompts
5. **Privacy-aware**: Allow users to control what gets captured and stored

## Capture Approaches

### 1. Real-time Prompt Capture
- Automatically capture every prompt as it's sent to the LLM
- Store with timestamp, context, and resulting code
- Background process with minimal UI presence

### 2. Manual Prompt Tagging
- Users explicitly mark prompts for capture
- Add tags, descriptions, or categories
- Useful for highlighting particularly effective prompts

### 3. Conversation Aggregation
- Group related prompts in multi-turn conversations
- Maintain conversation threads and context
- Export entire sessions or specific exchanges

### 4. IDE/Editor Integration
- Native integration with popular IDEs (VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.)
- Sidebar panels for prompt history
- Inline annotations linking code to prompts

### 5. CLI Wrapper Tools
- Command-line tools that intercept LLM interactions
- Automatic Git integration for version control
- Export capabilities for documentation
