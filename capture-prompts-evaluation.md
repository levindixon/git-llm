# Capture Prompts: Evaluation & Synthesis

## Executive Summary

After exploring the prompt-capture idea from four different angles (technical implementation, UX design, use cases, and existing solutions), this document synthesizes the findings and provides recommendations for implementation.

## üéØ Core Innovation

Your idea fills a critical gap - no existing tool captures the "why" and thought process behind AI-assisted code changes. This creates a new category of development artifact: the "AI Development Record."

## üí° Most Promising Approach: Hybrid Implementation

Based on the research, I recommend a phased approach:

### Phase 1: CLI Wrapper Tool
- Start with `git-llm` wrapper that captures prompts automatically
- Use Git trailers for simple prompt storage in commit messages
- Create `.prompts/` directory for rich metadata
- Minimal friction, works with any LLM tool

### Phase 2: IDE Integration
- VS Code extension for seamless capture
- Link prompts to specific code blocks
- Visual prompt history sidebar
- Auto-capture with manual refinement

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Web dashboard for team insights
- Prompt pattern library
- Search and analytics
- Integration with existing tools (Jira, ADRs)

## üèÜ Key Benefits Identified

1. **Knowledge Transfer**: New developers understand not just what changed, but why
2. **Living Documentation**: Requirements and decisions captured at implementation time
3. **Team Learning**: Build collective knowledge of effective AI usage
4. **Debugging Context**: Original intent helps fix issues correctly
5. **Compliance**: Clear audit trail of AI-assisted development

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Considerations

1. **Privacy**: Need robust sanitization to prevent sensitive data in prompts
2. **Adoption**: Must be zero-friction or developers won't use it
3. **Storage**: Smart strategy needed to avoid repository bloat
4. **Maintenance**: Prompts must remain relevant as code evolves

## üöÄ Recommended MVP

```bash
# Initialize in any Git repo
git-llm init

# Wrap any LLM interaction
git-llm chat "Create a REST API for user management"
# ... AI generates code ...

# Commit with prompt automatically included
git-llm commit -m "feat: add user management API"

# View prompt history
git-llm log
git-llm show HEAD
```

## üìä Success Metrics

- Adoption rate among development teams
- Reduction in onboarding time for new developers
- Increase in successful code reviews
- Improvement in debugging efficiency
- Positive feedback on knowledge preservation

## Research Findings Summary

### 1. Technical Implementation Research
- Explored 5 different Git integration approaches
- Created working examples for Git hooks, CLI tools, and Python implementation
- Designed JSON schema for standardized prompt metadata
- Hybrid approach combining Git trailers and .prompts directory most flexible

### 2. UX Design Research
- Designed 5 different user interaction models
- Created detailed workflow mockups for IDE, CLI, web, and mobile interfaces
- Identified dual capture modes (active/passive) as key to adoption
- Progressive enhancement strategy from simple CLI to full platform

### 3. Use Cases Analysis
- Identified 6 major benefit categories with specific scenarios
- Knowledge transfer and debugging context show highest value
- Compliance and audit trails increasingly important for regulated industries
- Main concerns: privacy, storage, workflow friction

### 4. Existing Solutions Research
- No current tool captures AI conversation context with commits
- Conventional commits and ADRs solve different problems
- AI commit tools only analyze diffs, miss original intent
- Clear market gap for "AI Development Records"

## Conclusion

Your idea addresses a real need in modern AI-assisted development. The key to success will be starting simple (CLI tool), proving value, then expanding based on user feedback. The hybrid approach allows both immediate value and future sophistication.

## Next Steps

1. Build MVP CLI tool (`git-llm`)
2. Test with small team on real project
3. Gather feedback and iterate
4. Expand to IDE integration based on usage patterns
5. Consider open-sourcing to build community
